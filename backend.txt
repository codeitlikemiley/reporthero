Go to a Campaign

get list Id of that Campaign
then get list associated to it...

missing piece is the EMAIL LIST...

we import list
and pass it as argument of emails
as such email='george.washington@example.com,thomas.jefferson@example.com'
GET https://a.klaviyo.com/api/v1/list/LusLxg/members?api_key=pk_b293845bc579c6a24a4ff29e0d813f5987

if it is in a list we will have the person ID we will save the person Object as a Use in our backend.


then we can then use it to get a person specific activity at this api end point and save it also in the backend
GET https://a.klaviyo.com/api/v1/person/{{PERSON_ID}}/metric/{{METRIC_ID}}/timeline

The other Work Around is go to the List Api 
to show all list
then go to specific list 
then import email 
then check if it is in the list 
then get the person object 
then save person timeline base on metrics or all metrics
